### spacetime [inane drivel]
Do you ever worry that youâ€™re retarded and no one is telling you? I sure don't.
There are a millions of smart math heads and physicists that have much more involved, crazy and grounded ideas than this. I just wanted to write it down since as a snapshot of ideas that frequently cross my mind.

What is time to a formally defined system? It's probably impossible to express and the question is flawed.

Assuming we live in a simulation, *all time* might have already happened and might be experiencing some sort of sweep through other variables.
Spacetime might appear uniform only because it is an incomprehensibly complex artifact of some other latent space and any variation appears as just noise fluctuations.

On the other hand, weird behavior like quantum stuff seemingly being entangled might be an optimization or just a side effect of a non-rigorous definition of the system being simulated in conventional spacetime coords.


## in praise of sloppiness
nothing is perfect. there is no escaping failure. you can't eliminate tech debt in advance. i will go around your approval process. things must crash and burn. perfectionism is a sin.

## notypes
Please don't tell me your type system needs no escape hatches. It's like having a driving coach in the front seat of your car at all times. Good at first, but then it only adds stress and reaction time. You can spend a good chunk of time either bikeshedding or just modeling around artificial abstractions.
I think a parser that converts between different languages might give one more freedom than the most expressive type system in the world.
